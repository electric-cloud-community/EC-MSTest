    <!-- The tool description should answer these kinds of questions:
What is the tool itself is used for in the development
process? Who would use this tool? What is the general use-case or
problem that this tool solves? Look at the tool's documentation or
website(s) to get their own descriptions. Look at Wikipedia or other
outside websites. If there is a Hudson plugin, read their
documentation for ideas, examples, etc. It's OK to copy word-for-word
only if appropriate, such as FOSS - but not commercial software.

    <p>MSTest is a command line utility from Microsoft that
    executes unit tests created in Visual Studio 2005, Visual
    Studio 2008, or Visual Studio 2010.</p>

    <p>This command has several options you can use to customize
    your test run. You can use many of these options in conjunction
    with one another; in fact, you must use certain options in
    conjunction with others, as described in the following
    sections. MSTest does not interpret the options nor the values
    you specify for them in a case-sensitive manner.</p>

    <h2>MSTest Links</h2>

    <p>More information can be found at <a href=
    "http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182489(v=vs.80).aspx">

    <h2>ElectricFlow Integration to MSTest</h2>
    <!-- The integration description should answer the questions:
How deep does our integration go? Why should I care? What general
functionality does the plugin include? What functionality does
the plugin omit?
-->

    <p>@PLUGIN_KEY@ plugin calls the MSTest tool via command line
    and passes the user-provided parameters.</p>

    <p>@PLUGIN_KEY@ plugin includes the most important features
    provided by the MSTest tool, also allows some extra
    funcionality to make the test more configurable according to
    specific needs. This plugin does not include options to print
    the labels, identifiers, descriptions, amoung others since they
    do not represent important information and would make the
    output less clear.</p>

    <p>ElectricFlow itself provides some advantages like
    parameters checking, easy functionality selection using only
    check boxes or radio buttons, hitorical log reports, procedure
    duration statistics, simple credentials attachment, real time
    analysis of the log been generated, among others.</p>

    <h2>Integrated Version</h2>

    <p>This plugin was developed and tested against version present
    on Visual Studio 2008.</p>

    <h1>Plugin Procedures</h1>

    <p>IMPORTANT: For all parameter descriptions below, required
    parameters are shown in <span class='required'>bold
    italics</span>.</p>

    <div id="runMSTest"><a name='runMSTest' id="runMSTest"></a>

    <h3>Run MSTest</h3>

    <p>This procedure allows the input of all necessary parameters
    along with some extra of them to make the test more
    configurable. When the parameters are defined the MSTest test
    command is created and run into the Commander, displaying at
    the end the result(s) of it. It displays a summary, which
    updates while the test is running, of the failed and passed
    test(s), this is also a link to the specific failed test(s) to
    know where and which one failed. It also creates a log file,
    which contains the output generated by the console.</p>

    <p>There are dependent fields, which are 'MSTest File Name' and
    'Test List' because the use of a Test List is only allowed if
    the file extension is 'vsmdi', otherwise the 'Test File' field
    will be ignored. When the file extension is '.dll' '
    /testcontainer:' command-line option will be used and when the
    file extension is 'vsmdi' ' /testmetadata:' command-line option
    will be used.</p>
